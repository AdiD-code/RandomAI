Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Necessary libraries (Common libraries include numpy, pandas, matplotlib. Install using pip install <library_name>).

Running the Experiments:

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/AdiD-code/RandomAI.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd <repo_name>

Install required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt 

Open the project in your IDE or code editor.

Run the Python scripts:

Each experiment has its own Python script. Locate the script and execute it from your terminal or IDE.
